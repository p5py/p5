=====

We are happy to announce the final developmental release under the summer fellowship at `The Processing Foundation <https://processingfoundation.org/>`_.
The project was supervised by `Mark Zhang <https://github.com/ziyaointl>`_. This release adds on to the experimental 2D renderer using `Skia <https://skia.org/>`_.


New Features
------------

- Typography support for skia `#371 <https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues/371>_.`
    - p5py now support all types of fonts as found in other processing ports
    - 5x efficiency in font sketches as compared to vispy renderer

- Image APIs for "skia" `#344 <https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues/379>_.`

- Support for Offscreen buffers `#386 <https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues/386>_.`
    - create_grahpics is now available in p5py's skia renderer

- Support for python 3.10 

This release includes contributions from @tushar5526, @ziyaointl, @Mr-Sunglasses, Thank you!

PS: There are a lot of good open issues that currently need help and we would love your contributions!


NOTE
----

``pyopengl-accelarate`` is omitted from the ``requirements.txt``
temporarily. See #397 for more information about this. If you are
looking for better 3D performance you can install it from the
``requirements.txt`` file.
