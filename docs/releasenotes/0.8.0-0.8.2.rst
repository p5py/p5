0.8.0-0.8.2
***********

We are happy to announce another developmental release under the summer fellowship at `The Processing Foundation <https://processingfoundation.org/>`_.
The project was supervised by `Mark Zhang <https://github.com/ziyaointl>`_. This release comes with an experimental 2D renderer using `Skia <https://skia.org/>`_.
The skia 2D renderer shows significance improvements in both rendering and efficiency of the sketches.


v0.8.0
=======

Bug Fixes
--------------
- #276
- #311
- #308
- #309
- #355
- #352

New Features
------------

- Along with the snake_case convention we support the camelCase convention for most Processing APIs #280
- New experimental 2D renderer "skia" #344. Skia currently does not support typography and Image APIs, they will be implemented in further releases.

List of New APIs
----------------------
  - :any:`frame_rate` sets frame rate for a sketch (only for skia)
  - :any:`rect` now supports border radius (only for skia)
  - :any:`CORNERS` CORNERS mode added (only for skia)
  - :any:`focussed` holds whether the current window is in focus or not (only for skia)

All the API previously present are supported as well in skia.

``Here are some profiling results comparing the time taken to draw 100 frames for different sketches``

v0.8.1
======

We are happy to announce the final developmental release under the
summer fellowship at `The Processing
Foundation <https://processingfoundation.org/>`__ The project was
supervised by `Mark Zhang <https://github.com/ziyaointl>`__. This
release adds on to the experimental 2D renderer using
`Skia <https://skia.org>`__.

New Features
------------

Typography support for skia #371
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   - p5py now support all types of fonts as found in other processing ports
   - 5x efficiency in font sketches as compared to vispy renderer

Image APIs for “skia” #344
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Offscreen buffers #386
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   - create_grahpics is now available in p5py's skia renderer

Support for python 3.10 #395
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   - Please see the attached note below

This release includes contributions from @tushar5526, @ziyaointl, and
@Mr-Sunglasses, Thank you!

PS: There are a lot of good open issues that currently need help and we
would love your contributions!

NOTE
----

``pyopengl-accelarate`` is omitted from the ``requirements.txt``
temporarily. See #397 for more information about this. If you are
looking for better 3D performance you can install it from the
``requirements.txt`` file.
