0.8.0
=====

We are happy to announce another developmental release under the summer fellowship at `The Processing Foundation <https://processingfoundation.org/>`_.
The project was supervised by `Mark Zhang <https://github.com/ziyaointl>`_. This release comes with an experimental 2D renderer using `Skia <https://skia.org/>`_.
The skia 2D renderer shows significance improvements in both rendering and efficiency of the sketches.

Bug Fixes
--------------
- #276
- #311
- #308
- #309
- #355

New Features
------------

- Along with the snake_case convention we support the camelCase convention for most Processing APIs #280
- New experimental 2D renderer "skia" #344. Skia currently does not support typography and Image APIs, they will be implemented in further releases.

List of New APIs
----------------------
  - :any:`frame_rate` sets frame rate for a sketch (only for skia)
  - :any:`rect` now supports border radius (only for skia)
  - :any:`CORNERS` CORNERS mode added (only for skia)
  - :any:`focussed` holds whether the current window is in focus or not (only for skia)

All the API previously present are supported as well in skia.
