p5 is a native Python port of the `Processing
<https://processing.org/>`_ API by `Abhik Pal
<https://github.com/abhikpal>`_, `Manindra Mohrarna
<https://github.com/Manindra29>`_, and `contributors
<https://github.com/p5py/p5/graphs/contributors>`_. Processing "is a
flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code
within the context of the visual arts." It mainly developed in Boston
(at Fathom Information Design), Los Angeles (at the UCLA Arts Software
Studio), and New York City (at NYU's ITP) [#processing-dev]_.

The p5 documentation is structured into:

- An :doc:`Installation <install>` section that guides one
  through the basic installation process.
- :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` with a collection of step-by-step
  lessons covering various parts of the p5 api.
- Short :doc:`Guides <guides/index>` that discuss key concepts and
  details at a fairly high level.
- The :doc:`Reference <reference/index>` provides a detailed overview
  of the complete p5 api. Code examples accompanying the reference can
  be found in the `references` directory in the `p5 examples
  <https://github.com/p5py/p5-examples>`_ repository (also `available
  as a zip <https://github.com/p5py/p5-examples/archive/master.zip>`_)

p5 is free and open source software and has been `released under the
GPL3 license <https://github.com/p5py/p5/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. To
report a bug / make a feature request use the `issues page
<https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues>`_ on the `main repository
<https://github.com/p5py/p5>`_. You can also use the `discourse platform <https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5py/27>`_ to ask / discuss anything related to p5py.
