# Run the visual test
```
python sanity_testing.py
```

**NOTE**: If you get a `ModuleNotFound or ImportError` make sure you export the `project's root path` to `PYTHONPATH` variable.

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/project"
```

Or you could either use [rootpath](https://pypi.org/project/rootpath/) to find the project's rootpath and then export the path.
